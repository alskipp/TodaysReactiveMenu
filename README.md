Today's Menu is an example app exploring **ReactiveCocoa 3.0 beta 4** using the **MVVM** pattern and **Swift 1.2**. The app uses Carthage, but everything has been committed, making it easier for any reader to just clone and run the app.

Along the app, a blog post has been created explaining the process. The post can be found here: *coming soon*.
