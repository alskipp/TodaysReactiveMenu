Today's (Reactive) Menu is an example app exploring **ReactiveCocoa 3.0 beta 4** using the **MVVM** pattern and **Swift 1.2**.

Along the app, a blog post has been created explaining the process. The post can be found here: *coming soon*.

PS: Sorry, for the menu being in Danish. The lunch provider at my work only publishes the menu in Danish :)

## Setup
The app uses **Carthage** for handling third-party dependencies, however everything has been committed to the repo making it easier for any reader to clone and build the app. If you want to change the dependencies, make sure to read [Carthage's guide](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) on how to proceed.

## Useful resources
ReactiveCocoa 3 is, at the time of writing, still very new and because of that, the resources are limited. Here are some good places to get you started:

 - [ReactiveCocoa 3.0 changelog](https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveCocoa/blob/swift-development/CHANGELOG.md) (make sure to see the implementation, tests and issues as well)
 - Colin Eberhardt's [ReactiveTwitterSearch](https://github.com/ColinEberhardt/ReactiveTwitterSearch)
 - [This](http://nomothetis.svbtle.com/an-introduction-to-reactivecocoa) and [this](http://nomothetis.svbtle.com/reactivecocoa-ii-reacting-to-signals) post by Alexandros Salazar
 - The [reactivecocoa-3](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/reactive-cocoa-3) tag on SO

## Contributing or questions?
Feel free to open an issue or ping me at [@steffendsommer](http://twitter.com/steffendsommer) if you have any questions. I'm fully aware that I took some corners and that I'm far from comfortable with RAC3 yet, so any useful PR's are more than welcome.
